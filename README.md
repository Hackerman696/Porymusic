Hi if you wanna use this it's in a super mega testing phase rn, but run " python3 -m midi_editor.app " in the app folder and it will launch.
I dont know if you have to install the dependencies because i'm an idiot, but the dependencies you have to install is obviously python and then; qtpy, PyQt6, mido,
python-rtmidi. I will make a .totml for this later but right now im tired. controls are scroll wheel to scroll view, CMD +scroll to zoom x axis and ALT +scroll to
zoom the other axis. just have import a midi file mess around and have some fun this is not a real build.
